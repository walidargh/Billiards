<h2>The mechanics are pretty simple</h2>
<h2>Drag the cue back with your mouse and release to strike the cueball</h2>
<h2>The further you pull back the harder it will strike!</h2>

<h2>If you click the cue ball while it is still moving to active the Canon Ball!</h2>
<h2>Be careful the ball will behave unpredictably! But if timed well it can have excellent results</h2>
<h2>You will have three canonballs, use them wisely</h2>
